# Expand Design Analysis

Read the competitor analysis from `/generated/competitor-analysis.md` and expand on the `<pondering>` insights.

## Task:
Transform the design analysis into actionable guidance by adding:

### 1. Philosophy Section
For each analyzed app, explain:
- **Core Design Beliefs**: What principles drive this aesthetic?
- **Emotional Target**: What specific feelings does this design evoke?
- **User Psychology**: How does this design influence user behavior?
- **Brand Personality**: What character traits does this design communicate?

### 2. How To Leverage Section
For each style guide, provide:
- **Color Application**: When to use each color, what emotions they trigger
- **Typography Rules**: Hierarchy guidelines, readability best practices
- **Component Usage**: Specific implementation guidance for buttons, cards, etc.
- **Layout Principles**: Spacing rules, visual hierarchy, content organization
- **Do's and Don'ts**: Common mistakes to avoid, best practices to follow
- **Implementation Examples**: Concrete scenarios for using each element

### 3. Cross-App Synthesis
- **Pattern Recognition**: What design patterns appear across multiple successful apps?
- **Adaptability**: How can these principles work across different app categories?
- **User Experience**: How do these choices create better user experiences?

## Output:
Save the expanded analysis to `/generated/styles.md` with:
- Original competitor analysis
- Philosophy sections for each app
- How To Leverage guides for each style system
- Synthesis insights for cross-platform design principles

This becomes the foundation for merging insights with the user's specific app concept.
